Install the prerequisites:

sudo apt-get install fakeroot build-essential crash kexec-tools makedumpfile \
	kernel-wedge libncurses5 libncurses5-dev libelf-dev asciidoc \
	binutils-dev git libunbound-dev devscripts \
	htmldoc man2html libcurl4-openssl-dev dpatch libssl-dev \
	module-assistant

(or try: sudo apt-get build-dep --no-install-recommends libreswan)

for now, test with "make deb" to build everything. will be split into
kmod/dkms

Choose between a kmod kernel package or a dkms kernel package:

kmod: Compiles static kmod package that can be installed specific for 1 kernel
dkms: Recompiles automatically on kernel upgrade but requires compiler

Some people prefer the flexibility of dkms over kmod. You can apt-get install
a new kernel and the dkms package will be recompiled. Other people prefer a
kmod package that is specific to one kernel, but it does not require the
target system has a fully functional build environment with compiler installed.

dkms:
- on build machine: sudo apt-get install dkms
