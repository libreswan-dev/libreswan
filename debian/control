Description: Internet Key Exchange daemon
 Libreswan is an IPsec implementation for Linux. It has support for most
 of the extensions (RFC + IETF drafts) related to IPsec, including
 IKEv2, X.509 Digital Certificates, NAT Traversal, and many others.

 Libreswan has been forked from Openswan 2.6.38, which was forked from
 FreeS/WAN 1.99.
 .
 The Libreswan IKE daemon is named pluto. It was inherited from the FreeS/WAN
 project, but provides improved X.509 certificate support and other features.
