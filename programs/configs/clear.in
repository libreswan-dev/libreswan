# This file defines the set of CIDRs (network/mask-length) to which
# communication should always be in the clear. One IPv4 or IPv6 CIDR per line.

# If running a recursive DNS server with query minimalization, one could
# opt to always send DNS root server traffic in the clear to speedup
# starting with an empty cache. It is not required though.
