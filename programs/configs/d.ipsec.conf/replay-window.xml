<para>The size of the IPsec SA replay window protection. The default is kernel stack
specific, but usually 32. Linux NETKEY/XFRM and Linux KLIPS support up to 64. A value
of 0 disables replay protection. Disabling of replay protection is sometimes used on
a pair of IPsec servers in a High Availability setup. Note that technically, at least
the Linux kernel can install IPsec SA's with an IPsec SA Sequence Number, but this is
currently not supported by libreswan.
