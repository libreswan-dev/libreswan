<para>Set the length of time (in time units, defaults to seconds) that we
will idle without hearing back from our peer. After this period
has elapsed with no response and no traffic, we will declare the peer dead,
and remove the SA (default <literal>120</literal>
seconds).  If dpdtimeout is set, dpdaction also needs to be set.</para>
