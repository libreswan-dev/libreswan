IKE padding is allowed in IKEv1 but it is known to cause interoperability
issues. The ikepad= option can be used to disable IKEv1 padding. This
is required for some devices (such as Checkpoint in Aggressive Mode)
that reject padded IKEv1 packets. In IKEv2, no padding is allowed,
and this option has no effect. If you find a device that seems to
require IKE padding in IKEv2, please contact the libreswan developers.
This option should almost never be enabled.
