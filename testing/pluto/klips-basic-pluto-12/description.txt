KLIPS test for passthrough of a single port

A standard westnet-eastnet IPsec SA is established. A passthrough IPsec SA is
setup for port 22 with. Packets for port 22 SHOULD NOT be encrypted with IPsec.
Packets for port 222 SHOULD be encrypted with IPsec

This test case passes the policy checks within KLIPS, but since the only "route"
from westnet to eastnet is via tunnel and this tunnel excludes port 22, the result
for port 22 is CORRECTLY "No route to host".

this test is probbly better done with a road-east test to avoid the no route.
