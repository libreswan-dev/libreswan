As newoe-18-poc-poc, but now the ping bursts out a few packets so that
there are packets during the initial IKE. This test case should show
that there are not two IPsec SA's started but only one.

  icmp ->  X
  IKE_INIT_REQ A ->
   icmp ---->
               X <-- icmp reply
            <- IKE_INIT_REQ B

And two IPsec SA's establish
