<para>whether IPComp compression of content is proposed on the connection
(link-level compression does not work on encrypted data,
so to be effective, compression must be done <emphasis remap='I'>before</emphasis> encryption);
acceptable values are
<emphasis remap='B'>yes</emphasis>
and
<emphasis remap='B'>no</emphasis>
(the default).

As of libreswan 3.1, both ends <emphasis remap='B'>must</emphasis>
agree. In previous versions of libreswan, openswan and freeswan,
compression was always accepted even if not configured. In light of the
BEAST attacks on TLS, using compression and encryptions has come under
more scrutiny, and it was decided that it should be possible for the local
policy of an endpoint to disallow  compression.  A value of
<emphasis remap='B'>yes</emphasis> causes pluto to propose compression and reject
proposals without it.  A value of <emphasis remap='B'>no</emphasis>
prevents pluto from proposing compression; a proposal to compress will
be <emphasis remap='B'>rejected</emphasis>.</para>
