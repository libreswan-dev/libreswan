<para>This option is ignored for now. It used to determine if Opportunistic Encryption will
be enabled. Opportunistic Encryption is the term to describe using IPsec
tunnels without prearrangement. It uses IPSECKEY or TXT records to
announce public RSA keys for certain IP's or identities. However, this feature is going to
be moved outside of the pluto IKE daemon into a separate process, more closely tied with a
local DNS(SEC) server. The default value used to be <emphasis remap='B'>no</emphasis>, so
this should not affect anyone. Contact the developers if you are interested in working on
the re-implementation of OE.
