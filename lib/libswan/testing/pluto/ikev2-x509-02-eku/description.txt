Test X509 certificates with a non-empty EKU section that does not
contain serverAuth or clientAuth. This generates an error for NSS
up to at least 3.39. A patched nss with IPsec profiles support
passes this test.

console output is based on the patched nss with certificateUsageIPsec
suport and a build of libreswan with NSS_HAS_IPSEC_PROFILE=true

It might take a few weeks for these changes to make it into the
various testing systems.
