This tests the IKEv1 Notify/Delete message. If east receives the notification,
it will delete the IPsec SA and traffic will flow cleartext. If not, it will
block the cleartext and this test will fail.

There is no real reason this test still uses "whack" directly - it was left as an
example and test for direct whack usage.
